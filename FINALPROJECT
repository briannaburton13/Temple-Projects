Problems whe meet while coding: 1.Debugging 2.Stories with multiple paths take hours of debugging 3.How to utilize tabs better in code 4.trying to fit everyone time together because we were all focused on finals and other classworks.

Fun while coding: 1.Working with a team of similar minded brains, and everyone did their fair share 2.We didn't had laughs when we made small or dumb mistakes because we knew it wasn't that bad and it wasn't going to be the end of the world.

Overcame the problems: 1.We worked for hours on debugging no trick to overcome it just hard work and dedication. 2.We slightly tweaked our game from the original version and instead made a full text based adventure game
